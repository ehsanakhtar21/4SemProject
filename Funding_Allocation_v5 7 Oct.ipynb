        "6. **Compl:**  This column represents the duality gap, also known as the complementarity gap. It's a measure of the difference between the primal and dual objective values. A smaller duality gap indicates that the solution is closer to optimality. The algorithm aims to reduce this gap with each iteration.\n",

        "The barrier method, as we've discussed, is an interior-point method. It finds a solution that typically lies in the \"interior\" of the feasible region, rather than at a vertex (corner point) of the feasible region. While this is mathematically valid and gives the correct objective value, many applications and users expect solutions that are basic feasible solutions (BFS) — that is, solutions at the vertices of the feasible region. This is especially true for linear programming problems.\n",
